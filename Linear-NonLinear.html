*it is also called as static pipeline as it performs fixed functions.<br>
* output is always produced from the last block.  <br>
* has linear connections.<br>
*allows easy functional partitioning.  <br>
* generates a single reservation table.<br>
* a series of processors are connected together in a serial manner<br>
* data flows from the first block to the final block of processor. <br>

        *is also called as dynamic pipeline as it performs different functions.<br>
        *The output is not necessarily produced from the last block.<br>
        *has feedback and feed-forward connections.<br>
        *Functional partitioning is difficult in non-linear pipeline.<br>
        * generate more than one reservation table.<br>
        * different pipelines are present at different stages.<br>
        *the functions are dynamically assigned.
